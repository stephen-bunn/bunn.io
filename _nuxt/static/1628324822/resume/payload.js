The methods used by package management can also address other instances where the installation of software needs to be automated. One example of this is the environment produced by third party video game modifications. An adapted application of package management practices can help to solve the difficult problem of finding and installing a set of video game modifications that do not conflict with each other. This greatly benefits the environment by allowing third party contributions to be easily installed which fosters growth in both the developer and user community surrounding the environment. This thesis presents the theory and complexities behind package management and shows how it can be effectively applied to managing video game modifications by presenting examples of software that can extract relevant metadata from video game modifications and discover conflict free installation solutions."}],skills:[{name:"Operating Systems",keywords:["Linux","OSX","Windows"]},{name:"Deployment",keywords:["Docker","VMWare","Kubernetes"]},{name:"Version Control Systems",keywords:["Git",d,"GitLab","Bitbucket","GitKraken"]},{name:"Agile Managment Software",keywords:["Trello","Slack","Axosoft","Jira"]},{name:"Software Development",keywords:[h,"Postgres","SQL","Java","C","Ruby","Php"]},{name:"API Development",keywords:[h,"NodeJS","REST","JSON","XML","GraphQL"]},{name:"Web Development",keywords:["HTML","CSS","SCSS","JS","TS"]},{name:"Web Frameworks",keywords:["Vue.js","Angular","Electron"]}],languages:[{language:"English",fluency:"Native speaker"}],interests:[{name:"Cooking",keywords:["High fat","Low carb"]},{name:"Gaming",keywords:["Board games","Video games"]},{name:"Music",keywords:["Orchestral","Electronic"]}],references:[],dir:"\u002Fresume",path:"\u002Fresume\u002Fresume",extension:".json",createdAt:i,updatedAt:i}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Appalachian State University","stephen-bunn","2017-04-12","GitHub","2016-08-14","Computer Science","","Python","2021-08-07T08:25:56.879Z")));
