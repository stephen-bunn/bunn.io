### Hey there, I'm Stephen!

I'm a software developer interested in building _small_, **intuitive** solutions, mainly with Python.

Occasionally I [write](/posts) about the topics I'm exploring or the products I'm building.
These are mostly just opinion pieces that act as notes while I try to figure out what the heck I'm doing.

If you are looking to hire me, please check out my [resume](/resume) and email me at [hiring@bunn.io](mailto:hiring@bunn.io).

**Thanks for stopping by!**
