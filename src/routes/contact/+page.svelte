<p>
  I'm not <em>really</em> looking at taking on any new projects at the moment. However, I am open to
  offers for career opportunities given they meet my financial needs, lifestyle, and passions well.
</p>

  If you would like to get in touch with me about a position you are offering, please email me at
  <Link href="mailto:hiring@bunn.io" target="_blank">hiring@bunn.io</Link>.

  Instead, if you just want to chat about technology and things, you can find me on Mastodon as
